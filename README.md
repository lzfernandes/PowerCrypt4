# PowerCrypt4
PowerCrypt4 - The 4th Generation, the first public C#! Rewrite of the Original OmniBean Library!
A fully C# rewrite of OmniBean's PowerCrypt2, which used the IronPython runtime and was never released publicly.
Made possible with the source code given to us by OmniBean, rewritten with new functionality, combining
OmniBean.PowerCrypt2.RSA and OmniBean.PowerCrypt2.AES.

Also see mCrypt at OmniPhaser/mCrypt, which uses an older Python version of the same OmniBean PowerCrypt 2!

Brought to you by the OmniBean team, released under GPLv3.
